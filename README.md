# Industrial Paper Compactor Project

Welcome to the **Industrial Paper Compactor Project** repository! This project showcases an innovative solution for automating the compaction of paper using pneumatic cylinders, a slider-crank mechanism, and advanced control systems. Below, you will find a detailed walkthrough of the project along with multimedia documentation.

## 🚀 Overview

This paper compactor operates continuously to manage paper waste efficiently. Here's how the process works:  
1. A **slider-crank mechanism**, powered by the first pneumatic cylinder, rotates to place multiple papers into the base.  
2. A **sensor** detects when the base is full and activates the second cylinder to push the papers into the compaction area.  
3. The **third cylinder** compacts the paper firmly.  
4. The **fourth cylinder** pulls an exit slider, allowing the compacted paper to drop into the collection basket.  

This seamless, automated cycle ensures smooth and efficient operation.
